{"name":"Spacesim","tagline":"Solar system simulator","body":"Welcome to Space Simulator project\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis is a siple simulator of gravity flying in the space.\r\nIt operates with planets, satellites (planets of low mass) and stars (planets of big mass)\r\nThe standard equation of movement is solved by Kutta-Runge method.\r\n\r\nThis software is based on Pythin3.3 and PyGame1.9\r\n\r\nFor starting the simulator please use command line:\r\n\r\n**python3.3 main.py -f <configuratio>.ini**\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n**python3.3 main.py -h**\r\n\r\nSome configuration files are in the root folder.\r\n\r\nDuring the simulation you can use keyboard:\r\n* q or ESC    = Exit\r\n* p or SPACE  = Pause\r\n\r\nSimulation stops when two or more bodies crashes or maximum distance between two bodies getting very big.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHave a fun :-)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
